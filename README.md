# Ublock to Adaway

A simple solution to port custom filters from uBlock to Adaway.

## How it works

The concept is simple, we have a list of hosts files and the basic idea
is to merge them into one simple big host file and serve that to AdAway.

## Why is this relevant

Because adding custom host file to AdAway is a pain in the ass.

## How to I use this on AdAway?

Piece of cake! Just copy [this host](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ludo237/ublock-to-adaway/master/result.txt) and you are done.
